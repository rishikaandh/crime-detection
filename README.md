**Crime Detection in Vancouver and Chicago**
*Overview*
This GitHub repository contains code for a crime detection system that analyzes and visualizes the level of crime in Vancouver and Chicago. The system processes crime data, calculates crime levels, and generates maps to represent the crime distribution in these areas.

Please note that due to computational resource limitations, executing this code may require a powerful machine, especially when dealing with large datasets. In case your machine lacks the necessary computational power, preprocessed data and visualizations have been included in the repository for reference.

*Features*

Crime Data Analysis:
The code processes crime data from Vancouver and Chicago, extracting relevant information for analysis.
It categorizes crimes into different types and calculates the overall crime level for each area.

Crime Level Mapping:
Utilizing geospatial data, the code generates interactive maps that visually represent the crime levels in Vancouver and Chicago.
Different colors or markers on the map indicate the severity of crime in specific locations.

Data Preprocessing:
Preprocessed datasets are included for users with limited computational power, allowing them to explore the results without running resource-intensive computations.

*Requirements*
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Matplotlib
Folium (for interactive maps)

Note
If you encounter computational resource limitations, refer to the "preprocessed_data" folder for precomputed results.
For any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue.
Acknowledgments
This project is made possible by the open crime data provided by Vancouver and Chicago authorities.
